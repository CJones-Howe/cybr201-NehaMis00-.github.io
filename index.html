<h1> What I like </h1>
<h2> I can't decide on one topic so I'm doing 3 </h2>

<h3> Legos </h3>
<p style="color:blue"> One of my most favorite things to do is to build legos. <br>I have ADHD and lego's instructions happen to simulate my brain in the calm way. </br> </p>
    

<h3> The Land of Stories  </h3>
<p style="color:blue"> My favorite book series ever. <br>I struggled with reading for most of my childhood but when I found this series I was able to enjoy reading for the first time. </br> </p> 


<h3> Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIZ4U21DRlM"> Trailer </a> </h3>
